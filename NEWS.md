* `plot_model()` gets a `show.zeroinf`-argument to show or hide the zero-inflation-part of models in the plot.
* `plot_model()` gets a `jitter`-argument to add some random variation to data points for those plot types that accept `show.data = TRUE`.
* `plot_model()` gets a `legend.title`-argument to define the legend title for plots that display a legend.

* The `grid.breaks`-argument for `plot_model()` and `plot_models()` now also takes a vector of values to directly define the grid breaks for the plot.
* Better default calculation for grid breaks in `plot_model()` and `plot_models()` when the `grid.breaks`-argument is of length one.
* The `terms`-argument for `plot_model()` now also allows the specification of a range of numeric values in square brackets for marginal effects plots, e.g. `terms = "age [30:50]"` or `terms = "age [pretty]"`.
* For coefficient-plots, the `terms`- and `rm.terms`-arguments for `plot_model()` now also allows specification of factor levels for categorical terms. Coefficients for the indicted factor levels are kept resp. removed (see `?plot_model` for details).

* `plot_model(type = "diag")` now also shows random-effects QQ-plots for `glmmTMB`-models, and also plots random-effects QQ-plots for all random effects (if model has more than one random effect term).

## Bug fixes

* `plot_model(type = "re")` now supports standard errors and confidence intervals for `glmmTMB`-objects.
* Fixed typo for `glmmTMB`-tidier, which may have returned wrong data for zero-inflation part of model.

* The `...`-argument of `plot_model()` now also accepts the arguments `sep_in` and `sep_out`, which are passed down to `snakecase::to_any_case()` for case conversion of term labels (axis labels).
* The `title`-argument in `plot_model()` now also works for plotting random effects (`type = "re"`).
* `sjt.itemanalysis()` no longer returns a list of score items, but only a data frame of scores.

## Bug fixes

* `view_df()` did not work with double values (with decimal points) when `show.values = TRUE`.
* `view_df()` caused an error when a variable has completely missing values.
* `plot_models()` did not properly remove intercepts from output for survey models, when `show.intercept = FALSE`.
* `plot_models()` did not automatically transform axis for all applicable model types.
* `get_model_data()` did not work for marginal effects plots.

# sjPlot 2.4.0

## General

* The old `set_theme()` was removed. Instead, there are some new predifined themes available (see `?"sjPlot-themes"`). The former `sjp.setThemes()` was renamed to `set_theme()` instead.

## New functions

* `plot_model()` as replacement for `sjp.lm()`, `sjp.glm()`, `sjp.lmer()`, `sjp.glmer()` and `sjp.int()` (which will become deprecated in the future, and will later be removed).
* `get_model_data()` to get the data from plot-objects created with `plot_model()`.
* `font_size()`, `label_angle()` and `legend_style()` as convenient ways to tweak common ggplot-theme-elements.

## Changes to functions

* `view_df()` now better handles string variables and gets a `show.string.values`-argument to omit the output of values from string variables.
* `view_df()` gets a `max.len`-argument to truncate output for variables with many values.
* `view_df()` displays more information on non-labelled, numeric variables.
* `sjp.pca()` and `sjt.pca()` now give more informative error messages when just one component is extracted.

## Bug fixes

# sjPlot 2.3.3

## General

* Fixed issue with latest tidyr-update on CRAN.
* HTML-tables (`sjt.*`-functions) displayed in the viewer pane now automatically add a CSS-style for white page background. This fixes an RStudio issue on OS X, where the new look'n'feel used dark backgrounds in the viewer pane, making output hardly readable.

# sjPlot 2.3.2

## General

* Revising package code from scratch. Part of the old functions will be replaced by new ones, making the code base easier to maintain and reduce redundant functions by merging them together. In the course of the next updates, functions will first become deprecated and later defunct.
* Changed imports to avoid using deprecated functions.
* Use more informative warning- and error-messages for certain functions.

## New functions

* `plot_models()` as replacement for `sjp.lmm()` and `sjp.glmm()` (which are now deprecated).
* `sjp.fa()` and `sjt.fa()` to plot or print as table the results of factor analyses.

## Bug fixes

* The mean and standard deviation in the summary of `sjt.frq()` were not correctly computed, when `auto.group`-argument was specified. This bug was introduced in the last update and is not fixed again.
* Values of character vectors were not always correctly sorted in `view_df()` (if `show.frq = TRUE`).

# sjPlot 2.3.1

## General

* All `sjt`-functions can now be directly integrated into knitr-code-chunks, because sjPlot exports a knitr-print-method (see `vignette("sjtbasic", "sjPlot")`).
* `sjtab()` now also works within knitr-documents (see `vignette("sjtbasic", "sjPlot")`).
* Updated Namespace for functions that moved from package **sjstats** to **sjmisc**.

## Changes to functions

* Changed defaults for `save_plot()`.
* `save_plot()` now also supports _svg_-format.
* For effect-plots (`type = "eff"`), the `axis.title`-argument can now be used to change the title of y-axes.
* For `sjp.lm()`, `sjp.glm()`, `sjp.lmer()` and `sjp.glmer()`, if color palette has more values than needed, it is silently shortend to the required length.
* When plotting mixed models, argument `geom.colors` now also applies to plot-type `type = "ri.slope"`.
* Default correlation-method for `sjt.corr()` and `sjp.corr()` is now `pearson`.
* Argument `emph.p` for printing tables of regression models now defaults to `FALSE`.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed bug in `sjt.frq()` for variables with many missing values and labelled values that did not occur on that variable.
* Argument `value.labels` had no effect for `sjt.frq()`.
* Automatic label detection in `sjt.grpmean()` sometimes not worked for factors without variable labels.
* `sjp.glm()` used _Odds Ratios_ as default title for y-axis when plotting marginal effects. Fixed, now y-axis is correctly labelled.
* `sjt.glm()` used "Odds Ratios" as default column heading for the estimates, even for poisson or other models. Now the string for column headers is selected based on the first model input of the function.
* Solved issue with warning in prediction-plots (`type = "pred"`) for categorical variables on the x-axis.

# sjPlot 2.3.0

## General

* Vignettes were added to this package.

## Changes to functions

* You can use `geom.colors = "bw"` for linetype-plots, to create black & white figures that use different linetypes instead of different colors.
* `sjp.kfold_cv()` now also supports poisson and negative binomial regression models.
* `sjp.pca()` and `sjt.pca()` get a `rotation`-argument, to use either varimax- or oblimin-transformation of factor loadings.
* Argument `show.value` now also applies to bar plots in `sjp.pca()`. 
* `sjt.glm()`, for generalized linar (mixed) models, now shows adjusted standard errors, using the Taylor series-based delta method. 
* More precise rounding of percentage values in `sjt.xtab()`, `sjp.xtab()` and `sjp.grpfrq()`.
* Cramer's V in `sjt.xtab()` is now dentoted as _V_.
* `sjt.xtab()` gets a `...`-argument, to pass down further arguments to the test statistics functions `chisq.test()` and `fisher.test()`.
* `sjt.xtab()` gets a `statistics`-argument, to select one of different measures of associations for the table summary.

## Bug fixes

* Plotting or table output of regression models did not work with null-models (i.e. with intercept only).
