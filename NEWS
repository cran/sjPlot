Version 1.6.9
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New functions:
* Added new functions "sjd.norm", "sjd.chisq", "sjd.f" and "sjd.t" to plot distribution curves, optionally with shaded areas indicating the p-level area.

Changes to functions:
* Plotting single predictors of linear models (type = "pred" in function "sjp.lm") now also supports plotting interaction terms and factor levels. Needs parameter "x=TRUE" in lm-call to work.
* Added parameter "showCI" to "sjp.frq" to show 95% confidence intervals. Use "error.bar.colors" to change colors of error bars when using bar charts. In case of dot plots, error bars have the same color as dots (see "geom.colors").
* Added parameter "remove.spaces" to all "sjt"-function to remove leading spaces (parantheses of html-tags), which may make tables less cluttered when importing them into office applications.
* Added parameters "digits" and "digits.stats" to "sjt.stackfrq", to specifiy digits after decimal point for percentage and statistic values.
* Added parameter "atomic.to.fac" to "sji.SPSS", so variables with nominal or ordinal scale imported from SPSS data sets are imported as "factors", not as "atomic".
* "sjp.scatter" no longer needs both "x" and "y" to be specified, but at least one of them.
* "sjt.grpmean" now shows p-values for each group (retrieved from anova table).
* Added new theme-preset ('theme = "538"') to "sjp.setTheme".

Bug fixes:
* "sjt.grpmean" did not indicate p-values smaller than 0.001 as "p<0.001", but still as "p=0.000" - fixed.
* Fixed bug in function "sjs.stdmm", which was the cause for a bug with type = "fe.std" in "sjp.lmer".
* Fixed bug in "sjp.int" when fitted model does not contain p-values (e.g. when passing a merMod object from lme4).
* "sji.setValueLabels" did not set labels properly when paramerer "labels" was a list - fixed.
* Minor bug fix in "sjp.int".
* Minor bug fix in "sjp.setTheme".


Version 1.6.8
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes to functions:
* Plotting standardized beta values in "sjp.lm" can be achieved via the "type" parameter (type = "std"). Furthermore, confidence intervals and p-values are shown in the standardized beta plot.
* "sjt.lm" now also prints confidence intervals for standardized beta values.
* "sjp.vif" and "sjp.glm.ma" were merged into "sjp.glm". Use the "type" parameter to select plot type.
* "sjp.lm1", "sjp.reglin", "sjp.vif" and "sjp.lm.ma" were merged into "sjp.lm". Use the "type" parameter to select plot type.
* Added parameter "vars" to "sjp.glmer" to plot probability curves only for selected variables.
* Added type "fe.std" to "type" parameter of "sjp.lmer" to plot standardized coefficients of fixed effects.
* Added type "fe.ri" to "type" parameter of "sjp.lmer" to plot fixed effects slopes for each random intercept (group level).
* p-values less than 0.001 are indicated as "p < 0.001" instead of being rounded to "p = 0.000".
* Added parameter "showTotalN" to "sjt.xtab" to show column and row sums even if parameter "showObserved" is FALSE.
* Added parameter "digits.summary" to "sjt.grpmean" to use different digits for table values and summary statistics.
* "sji.setValueLabels" now also accepts a vector for the parameter "labels" if "x" is a data frame. Using a vector will apply the labels to each variable of the data frame "x".
* "sjt.frq" now by default automatically detects whether a variable has a certain proportion of zero-count values and does not print them by default then. Use "skipZeroRows = TRUE" or "skipZeroRows = FALSE" to explicitly show or remove zero-counts from the table.

Bug fixes:
* Fixed bug with type = "dots" in "sjp.grpfrq".
* Fixed bug with predictor labelling in "sjp.lm" and "sjp.glm" when parameter "labelPredictors" was not used.
* Fixed bug with custom color palettes and neutral categories in "sjp.likert".


Version 1.6.5

* "sjt.xtab" can now show/hide observed values in table cells with "showObserved" parameter.
* "sjt.df" now distinguishes more variable / vector types (like ordinal and categorial, instead of factor only, or double, integer and numeric).
* "sjp.lm1" no longer requires the data frame used to fit the model.
* Added parameter "useResiduals" to "sjp.lm1", so residuals may be plotted against predictor (for diagnostic purposes).
* Added parameters "showCountValues" and "showPercentageValues" to function "sjp.xtab", so either percentage value labels, count value labels or both can be printed.
* Removed parameters "maxYlim" and "upperYLim" from "sjp.grpfrq", "sjp.xtab" and "sjp.frq", and added "axisLimits.y" as new option to define y-axis-range.
* Parameter "labelPos" now also works for flipped coordinates in "sjp.xtab".
* Added parameters to define axis titles and intercept label for y axis to "sjp.glmer" and "sjp.lmer".

General:

Version 1.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General:
* Comprehensive online manual available at http://www.strengejacke.de/sjPlot/
* Most geom-aesthetics and theme-options have been removed from all "sjp"-functions. This allows more flexibility in creating own themes or using other packages that modify theme appearance. Use the new function "sjp.setTheme" to globally change theme- and geom-aesthetics for sjp-functions, or use packages like "ggthemr" or "ggthemes" to tweak the plot appearance.
* Replaced "b" with beta-sign in model-summary for "sjp.lm" and "sjp.lm1".
* Renamed "sju.aov1.levene" to "sjs.aov1.levene".
* Documentation / help files have been revised and cleaned up.

New functions:
* New function "sjp.setTheme" to globally change theme- and geom-aesthetics for sjp-functions.

* New function "sjs.etasq" to compute eta squared value for one-way-anovas.
* New function "sjs.se" to compute standard errors.

Changes to functions:
* sjp-functions now have a generic "geom.colors" (and, if applicable, also "geom.size") parameter to change geom-appearance. Most other aesthetics modifications should be made using "sjp.setTheme".
* All "sjt"-functions now auto-detect the character encoding depending on the platform's os-type (i.e. encoding-parameter defaults to NULL). Use parameter "encoding" to select a specific character encoding for the sjt-functions.
* "sjp.likert" was completely re-written and now offers to also plot a neutral ("don't know") category.
* "sji.getValueLabels" and "sji.getVariableLabels" now also accept single variables as parameter.
* "sjp.glm", "sjp.lm", "sjt.glm" and "sjt.lm" now automatically retrieve the predictor's variable labels, if possible. Note that factor variables have more "labels" (for each factor level) than possible variable label attributes, so automatic detection of varibale labels does not work in such cases.
* "sjp.corr" was revised and now plots circles only in upper and values only in lower triangle.
* Added further options to "type" parameter in "sjp.glm" to show additional plots with probability curves of coefficients.
* Added parameter "sort.frq" to "sjt.frq" to order frequencies ascending or descending.

* Parameter "valueLabelPosOnTop" in "sjp.xtab" was removed and replaced by "labelPos", which also allows centered label positioning.
* "sjp.lm.ma" now also plots residuals against predictors with scatter plots, if "completeDiagnostic" is TRUE.
* "sju.setNA" now removes value label attributes and value label names from those values that have been set to NA (so NA's are not associated with any value labels).
* Changed behaviour of "transformTicks" parameter in "sjp.glm" and "sjp.glmm" to get more pretty breaks for gridlines.
* Renamed parameter "flipCoordinates" to "coord.flip".
* Renamed parameter "useFacetGrid" to "facet.grid".

Bug fixes:
* Number of observations in "sjt.lm" was wrong in table - fixed.
* "sji.setVariableLabels" did not attach complete label list to data frame, but only to each vector - fixed.
* "sjp.frq", "sjt.frq" and "sjt.xtab" did not show (leading) categories with zero-counts - fixed.
* Legend labels in "sjp.grpfrq" were not shown (occured during implementation of ggthemr-support) - fixed.
* Fixed bugs with wrong label association for zero-categories in "sjt.frq".
* Fixed minor bugs in various "sjp"-functions, where ggthemr-theme-color were not applied to bar/point/line-colors.
* Fixed bug with dot plots in "sjp.grpfrq".
* Fixed bug with retrieving interaction terms from fitted models in "sjp.emm.int".
* Fixed bug in "sju.strpos" where returned indices in some cases were "1" instead of correct match.

Changes to functions:
* "sjt.frq" can now handle character vectors (string variables), see parameter "removeStringVectors".
* "sjt.frq" can automatically group string values in character vectors according to their distance metrics (similarity). This will merge different but similar values into a new, single value.
* Prefixes of statistical test functions have been renamed from "sju" to "sjs".
* Added "themr" option to "theme" parameter of all sjp-plotting function, so the sjPlot package can be used with the ggthemr-package (https://github.com/cttobin/ggthemr). You may use the "ggthemr::swatch" function to retrieve theme-colors as bar/point/line-colors.
* Added parameter "axisLimits.y" to function "sjp.emm.int"
* Added parameter "axisLimits.y" to function "sjp.lm.int"
* "sjp.lm" now shows adjusted r-square in model summary.
* "sjc.cluster", "sjc.qclus" and "sjc.dend" now also accept agglomeration options "ward.D" and "ward.D2" if you are using an R version later than 3.0.3.
* "sjt.itemanalysis" now calulates index scores based on "sju.mean.n" function (see parameter "minValidRowMeanValue").

General:
* Removed extracted single functions from other packages and added imports for those functions. sjPlot now also imports "psych" and "cluster" package.
* Removed packages cluster, coin, lsmeans and lmtest from required imports and moved them to suggested packages.

Bug fixes

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New functions:
* "sjp.emm.int" to plot estimated marginal means (least-squares means) of linear models with interaction terms.

Changes to functions:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New functions:
* "sjt.mic" to compute mean inter-item-correlation.

Changes to functions:
* All "sjt"-functions have enhanced options for the "CSS" parameter. With the plus-sign (+) you can add additional style sheets to the default styles. See examples in help files and on http://rpubs.com/sjPlot

For some functions, this will work only when paramater "title" resp. "axisTitle" (or similar, depending on the function) is set to "auto" (refer to documentation). Generally, this only works when varibales have a "variable.label" attribute (which can be set via the new "setVariableLabels" function).
* Functions "sjt.xtab" and "sjt.stackfrq" can now show missing values (parameter "showNA").
* Functions "sjt.xtab", "sjp.xtab" and "sjp.grpfrq" now computes Fisher's exact test instead of Chi-squared test when expected values in a table cell are lower than 5 (or lower than 10 if df is 1).

* Added parameter "cellSpacing" to functions "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm", which is a convenient parameter for changing cell spacing, alternatively to using the "CSS" parameter.

Bug fixes:

* Added parameter "no.output" to all "sjt." functions and to function "sji.viewSPSS", so opening a browser window or showing the output in a viewer pane can be avoided. Useful when the html-output should be used for knitr-documents.
* Added parameter "breakVariableLabelsAt" and "breakValueLabelsAt" to functions "sjt.xtab", which inserts line breaks at long labels.
* Added parameter "showFamily" to function "sjt.glm" to compare fitted glm with different link functions.

* Added parameter "startAxisAt" to function "sjp.grpfrq" for cases where variable values have a range starting with a higher lowest value (e.g. ranging from 5-15).

Bug fixes:
* Fixed bug in function "sjp.corr" with p-value-labels, when p-values were printed as "*".
* Fixed typo in functions "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm" where in the annotation row "*" was labelled as "p<0.005" (and not "p<0.05").
* Minor bug fixes.

Various:
* All "sjp." functions now (invisibly) return the ggplot-object as well as the underlying data frame by default. The "returnPlot" parameter was removed. In case you don't want to plot the graph, use the new "printPlot" parameter.

* Functions "sjt.frq", "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm" now invisibly return the style sheet definition and the web page content for further use, for instance if several lm-tables should be saved to a single html file see example).
* Functions "sjt.frq", "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm" now have more style attributes inside the style sheet definition, so it's easier to change the HTML-table's appearance via CSS.
* Function "sjc.dend" can now plot the rectangles for several cluster solutions (see help for parameter "groupcount").
* Function "sjc.elbow" now automatically removes missing cases from data frame.

Parameter changes:

* "sjp.lm1" to plot regression lines of fitted linear models with only one predictor (lm(y~x)).
* "sjt.frq" to save (multiple) frequency tables as HTML file.
* "sju.recodeTo" to recode variable's category values.
* "sju.dicho" to dichotomize variables.

Changes to functions:
* HTML tables generated with functions "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm" can now also be displayed in RStudio Viewer Pane or opened via web browser, if parameter "file=NULL" (default).
* Added VIF check (multicollinearity) for function "sjp.glm.ma".
* Enhancment of function "sju.groupVar". It's now possible to use "groupsize=auto" to automatically group variables into a maximum of 30 groups (ggplot-default binwidth-adjustment of histograms). The maximum amount of group can also be specified by the "autoGroupCount" parameter.
* Enhancment of function "sju.groupVarLabels". It's now possible to use "groupsize=auto" to automatically create variable labels for grouped variables with a maximum of 30 groups (ggplot-default binwidth-adjustment of histograms). The maximum amount of group can also be specified by the "autoGroupCount" parameter.

Parameter changes:
* Added parameter "autoGroupAt" to functions "sjp.frq" and "sjp.grpfrq" to automatically group variable with larger number of unique values into smaller units to prevent too many bars to be plotted.
* Added parameter "dots" to function "sjp.frq" to plot dot-plots.
* Added parameter "startAxisAt" to function "sjp.frq" for cases where variable values have a range starting with a higher lowest value (e.g. ranging from 5-15).
* Added parameter "flipCoordinates" to functions "sjp.lm" and "sjp.glm".
* Added parameter "axisLabelsAngle.x" to functions "sjp.lm" and "sjp.glm".
* Added several parameters to functions "sjt.lm" and  "sjt.glm" to show/hide the different model summary elements.
* Added parameter "labelDigits" to function "sjp.lm" and "sjp.glm" to change digits after decimal points for esitmators (value labels).
* Added parameter "labelDigits" to function "sjp.aov1" to change digits after decimal points for means (value labels).
* Added new parameters to function "sjp.lm.int" to plot intercept lines of predictors w/o interactions.
* Added parameter "returnPlot" to functions "sjp.reglin" and "sjp.lm.in". Multiple ggplot object will be returned as list.

Bug fixes:
* Fixed bug that added unnessecary line break in axis-, title- and legend-labels, which let them appear a bit misaligned.
* Fixed bug in VIF calculation (see "sjp.lm.ma").

Version 0.9
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New functions:
* "sju.adjustPlotRange.y" to adjust y-range of ggplot-objects, for instance if labels are out of visible range.

Changes to functions:
* With "sjp.aov1", positive and negative means can now be plotted in different colors. Thus, parameters "pointColor" and "barColor" were renamed and do now require a vector with two color values (instead of just one).
* Changed automatic calculation of grid breaks in function "sjp.aov1" and "sjp.lm" to have more pretty grid breaks at x axis.

Parameter changes:
* Added parameter "showAxisLabels.y" to functions "sjp.frq" and "sjp.grpfrq", so the tick mark values on the y-axis can be hidden.
* Added parameter "showCountValues" to functions "sjp.frq" and "sjp.grpfrq". Now either count or percentage values, or both can be printed or hidden. Use "showValueLabels" to generally hide value labels, and then use "showCountValues" and "showPercentageValues" to show/hide each.
* Added parameter "plevel" to function "sjp.lm.int", so also interactions that are above the 0.05 significance level may be plotted.
* Added parameter "axisLabelAngle.x" to function "sjp.aov1", which is helpful if bars are plotted and category labels that appear on the x-axis need to be rotated.
* Renamed parameter "pointColor" to "pointColors" in function "sjp.aov1".
* Renamed parameter "barColor" to "barColors" in function "sjp.aov1".
* Renamed parameter "reverseItems" to "reverseOrder" in function "sjp.likert".
* Renamed parameter "reverseX" to "reverseOrder" in function "sjp.stackfrq".
* Renamed parameter "reverseX" to "reverseOrder" in function "sjp.xtab".

Bug fixes:
* Fixed bug in function "sjp.aov1" when using type="bars" and showing error bars.
* Fixed bug in function "sjp.lm.int" that used wrong values for the predictor on the x-axis (value index instead of value itself was used).

Version 0.8
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added parameter "showConfInt" to functions "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm", so CI may be omitted from table output.
* Added parameter "orderBy" to function "sjp.stackfrq" so items can be ordered according their counts of first or last item category.
* Added "utils::globalVariables" to source to avoid notes during R CMD check.
* Updated imports and dependencies, so with selected importing of functions attaching requested libraries is no longer needed.
* Spell correction of function "sju.ao1.levene", which is now named "sju.aov1.levene".

Version 0.7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* New function "sji.convertToValue" to convert factor variables to numeric variables.
* Added parameter "hideGrid.x" to various functions, so the x-axis-gridlines can be hidden.
* Added parameter "hideGrid.y" to various functions, so the y-axis-gridlines can be hidden.
* Added parameter "returnPlot" to most plotting function, so the complete ggplot-object is returned by the function and can be further manipulated.

Version 0.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* New function "sjt.lm" to print results of linear regressions to HTML-tables.
* New function "sjp.aov1" to plot results of One-Way-Anovas.

* Added more variables to sample data set "efc".
* "geomAlpha" now also changes the alpha value of tiled geoms in function "sjp.corr".
* Fixed bug in "sjp.pca" function when calculating Cronbach's alpha from a dataframe with missing values.
* Fixed bug in "sjp.pca" function with "breakLabelsAt" parameter, which did not work when no axis-labels were supplied and the dataframe's column names were used as labels.
* Renamed function "sjp.lmma" to "sjp.lm.ma".
* Renamed function "sjp.glmma" to "sjp.glm.ma".
* Renamed function "sjp.lmint" to "sjp.lm.int".
* Added examples to functions "sjp.stackfrq", "sjp.corr", "sjp.pca".

Version 0.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* New function "sju.betaCoef" to calculate std. beta coefficients of linear models.
* Added more diagnostic plots to "sjp.glm.ma" function.
* Added loess-line to "sjp.reglin" function to compare linear with loess regression. See "?sjp.reglin" for more information.
* Added parameters "interactionVar" and "interactionVarLabel" to function "sjp.frq".
* Updated weblog reference URLs.
* Renamed parameters "y" in function "sjp.frq" to "varCount".

* Added examples to functions "sjp.grpfrq"and "sjp.frq".

Version 0.4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added parameters "titleSize" and "titleColor" to many functions, so the plot's title size and color can be modified.
* Fixed bug in "sjp.likert" function.
* Changed parameter "axisLabels.x" to "axisLabels.y" in "sjp.likert" function.
* Changed parameter "axisLabels.x" to "axisLabels.y" in "sjp.stackfrq" function.
* Default gray from axis labels was changed (darkened) from "darkgray" to "gray30" (which seems more suitable when creating graphics for presentation slides).

Version 0.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added new function "sjp.reglin" to plot and analyse single predictors against response for fitted linear models.
* Inlcuded sample dataset "efc".
* Added some examples using the new sample dataset.
