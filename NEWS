------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* New function "sjt.pca" to save/view results from PCA as html table.
* New function "sjt.corr" to save/view results from correlations as html table.
* New function "sjt.stackfrq" to save/view results from stacked frequencies or likert scales as html table.
* New function "sji.viewSPSS" to inspect variable structure of importet SPSS datasets.
* New function "sju.recode" (which is just a wrapper for the recode-function of the car package that is needed for sjPlot anyway).
* New function "sju.weight" to weight a variable / vector with specific weight factors.
* New function "sju.mwu", which is a small helper function to quickly perform Mann-Whitney-U-Tests.
* New function "sju.cronbach", which is a small helper function to quickly calculate Cronbach's alpha.
* New function "sju.reliability" to perform reliability tests on item scales.
* Functions "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm" no longer show annotation row when "pvaluesAsNumbers" is TRUE (since then no annotations are needed).
* Function "sjt.df" was re-structured. It now shows a data frame's description by default (see parameter "describe").
* All "sjt." functions as well as "sji.viewSPSS" now additionally return the object "knitr" which contains the html code with inline-css. Can be used to include the html-tables in knitr-markdown-documents and for importing html-files into office applications (such as MS Word or LibreOffice).
* Added parameter "useViewer" to all "sjt." functions and to function "sji.viewSPSS", which can be set to FALSE to force table output to be opened in a web browser.
* Added parameter "CSS" to all "sjt." functions and to function "sji.viewSPSS", which can be use to supply user-defined style-sheets to change the appearance of the html tables.
* Added parameter "no.output" to all "sjt." functions and to function "sji.viewSPSS", so opening a browser window or showing the output in a viewer pane can be avoided. Useful when the html-output should be used for knitr-documents.
* Added parameter "breakVariableLabelsAt" and "breakValueLabelsAt" to functions "sjt.xtab", which inserts line breaks at long labels.
* Added parameter "showFamily" to function "sjt.glm" to compare fitted glm with different link functions.
* Added parameter "showChi2" to function "sjt.glm" to optionally show chi-square-values of fitted models.
* Added parameter "showStdError" to functions "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm" to show standard error of fitted model in the table.
* Added parameter "showLegend" to function "sjt.xtab" so the color legend can be shown or hidden.
* Added parameters "showSkew" and "showKurtosis" to function "sjt.frq", so skewness and kurtosis of variables can be printed in the summary.
* Added parameter "startAxisAt" to function "sjp.grpfrq" for cases where variable values have a range starting with a higher lowest value (e.g. ranging from 5-15).
* All "sjp." functions now (invisibly) return the ggplot-object as well as the underlying data frame by default. The "returnPlot" parameter was removed. In case you don't want to plot the graph, use the new "printPlot" parameter.
* Removed function "sju.modsum.lm" from official namespace (cleaning-up), since it was too specific and not generally useful.
* Improved table layouts for "sjt." functions.
* Fixed bug in function "sjp.corr" with p-value-labels, when p-values were printed as "*".
* Fixed typo in functions "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm" where in the annotation row "*" was labelled as "p<0.005" (and not "p<0.05").
* Minor bug fixes.

Version 1.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* New function "sjp.scatter" to plot (grouped) scatter plots including fitted lines.

* New function "sjt.df" to save/view the content of data frames as HTML table.
* New function "sju.setNA" to quickly specify missing values.
* The functions "sjt.frq", "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm" now invisibly return the style sheet definition and the web page content for further use, for instance if several lm-tables should be saved to a single html file see example).
* The functions "sjt.frq", "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm" now have more style attributes inside the style sheet definition, so it's easier to change the HTML-table's appearance via CSS.
* Added parameter "jitterValueLabels" to functions "sjp.likert", "sjp.xtab" and "sjp.stackfrq" to avoid overlapping of narrow displayed value labels.
* Added paramter "encoding" to functions "sjt.frq", "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm", so the charset encoding of the output HTML file can be changed.
* Added parameters "distance" and "agglomeration" to functions "sjc.cluster" and "sjc.dend", so distance and agglomeration methods for hierarchical clustering can be specified.
* Added parameters "alternateRowColors" and "stringValue" to function "sjt.frq".
* Function "sjc.dend" can now plot the rectangles for several cluster solutions (see help for parameter "groupcount").
* Default value of "autoGroupAt" parameter in functions "sjp.grpfrq" and "sjp.frq" was set to NULL (auto-grouping turned off) because auto grouping leads to unexpected behaviour with violin plots, box plots and histograms (wrong scale range).
* Function "sjc.elbow" now automatically removes missing cases from data frame.
* Fixed bug in function "sjc.grpdisc" (missing values in data frame have not been removed).
* Fixed bug in function "sjp.likert" when a dropped level from the likert scale (parameter "dropLevels") was outside of the legendLabels index (i.e. "dropLevels" was greater than "length(legendLabes)".
* Spell corrections in documentation.

* New function "sju.recodeTo" to recode variable's category values.
* New function "sju.dicho" to dichotomize variables.
* HTML tables generated with functions "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm" can now also be displayed in RStudio Viewer Pane or opened via web browser, if parameter "file=NULL" (default).
* Added VIF check (multicollinearity) for function "sjp.glm.ma".
* Enhanced function "sju.groupVar". It's now possible to use "groupsize=auto" to automatically group variables into a maximum of 30 groups (ggplot-default binwidth-adjustment of histograms). The maximum amount of group can also be specified by the "autoGroupCount" parameter.
* Enhanced function "sju.groupVarLabels". It's now possible to use "groupsize=auto" to automatically create variable labels for grouped variables with a maximum of 30 groups (ggplot-default binwidth-adjustment of histograms). The maximum amount of group can also be specified by the "autoGroupCount" parameter.
* Added parameter "autoGroupAt" to functions "sjp.frq" and "sjp.grpfrq" to automatically group variable with larger number of unique values into smaller units to prevent too many bars to be plotted.
* Added parameter "dots" to function "sjp.frq" to plot dot-plots.

* Added parameter "flipCoordinates" to functions "sjp.lm" and "sjp.glm".
* Added parameter "axisLabelsAngle.x" to functions "sjp.lm" and "sjp.glm".
* Added several parameters to functions "sjt.lm" and  "sjt.glm" to show/hide the different model summary elements.

* Fixed bug in VIF calculation (see "sjp.lm.ma").

Version 0.9
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* New function "sju.adjustPlotRange.y" to adjust y-range of ggplot-objects, for instance if labels are out of visible range.
* Added parameter "showAxisLabels.y" to functions "sjp.frq" and "sjp.grpfrq", so the tick mark values on the y-axis can be hidden.
* Added parameter "showCountValues" to functions "sjp.frq" and "sjp.grpfrq". Now either count or percentage values, or both can be printed or hidden. Use "showValueLabels" to generally hide value labels, and then use "showCountValues" and "showPercentageValues" to show/hide each.
* Added parameter "plevel" to function "sjp.lm.int", so also interactions that are above the 0.05 significance level may be plotted.
* With "sjp.aov1", positive and negative means can now be plotted in different colors. Thus, parameters "pointColor" and "barColor" were renamed and do now require a vector with two color values (instead of just one).
* Changed automatic calculation of grid breaks in function "sjp.aov1" and "sjp.lm" to have more pretty grid breaks at x axis.
* Added parameter "axisLabelAngle.x" to function "sjp.aov1", which is helpful if bars are plotted and category labels that appear on the x-axis need to be rotated.
* Renamed parameter "pointColor" to "pointColors" in function "sjp.aov1".
* Renamed parameter "barColor" to "barColors" in function "sjp.aov1".
* Renamed parameter "reverseItems" to "reverseOrder" in function "sjp.likert".
* Renamed parameter "reverseX" to "reverseOrder" in function "sjp.stackfrq".

* Fixed bug in function "sjp.aov1" when using type="bars" and showing error bars.
* Fixed bug in function "sjp.lm.int" that used wrong values for the predictor on the x-axis (value index instead of value itself was used).

Version 0.8
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added parameter "showConfInt" to functions "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm", so CI may be omitted from table output.
