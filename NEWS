------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New functions:
* "sjt.mic" to compute mean inter-item-correlation.

Changes to functions:
* All "sjt"-functions have enhanced options for the "CSS" parameter. With the plus-sign (+) you can add additional style sheets to the default styles. See examples in help files and on http://rpubs.com/sjPlot
* "sjt.itemanalysis" now also computes the mean inter-item-correlation for each scale.

For some functions, this will work only when paramater "title" resp. "axisTitle" (or similar, depending on the function) is set to "auto" (refer to documentation). Generally, this only works when varibales have a "variable.label" attribute (which can be set via the new "setVariableLabels" function).

* Functions "sjt.xtab", "sjp.xtab" and "sjp.grpfrq" now computes Fisher's exact test instead of Chi-squared test when expected values in a table cell are lower than 5 (or lower than 10 if df is 1).
* Function "sju.reliability" now returns NULL if data frame has too less columns.
* Function "sjt.df" now also includes amount and proportion of missings when describing a data frame.

Return value changes:
* Changed return value of function "sjc.qclus". Parameter "classification" now contains the group classification, including missing values, so this vector can be appended to the original data frame (because it has the same row length now).
* Changed return value of function "sjc.cluster". The group classification now includes missing values, so this vector can be appended to the original data frame (because it has the same row length now).

* Added several "digits." parameters to functions "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm" to specifiy the amount of decimals for different values (estimators, ci, p etc.).
* Added parameter "digits" to function "sjp.pca", so amount of decimals for values can be defined.
* Added parameter "groups" to function "sjc.qclus", which can be used to plot existing cluster solutions without computing a new cluster analysis on the data frame.
* Added parameter "showN" to function "sjt.stackfrq" for showing count values in table cells.
* Added parameter "exp.coef" to function "sjt.glm" to display non-exponentiated coefficients.
* Added parameter "repeatHeader" to function "sjt.df", which adds the header row to the end of the table. Useful when having long tables.

* Added parameter "printPlot" to function "sjc.grpdisc", to suppress plotting the graph, if needed.
* Added parameter "newLineConf" to functions "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm", which can be used to add a line break between OR-/B- and CI-values, if OR-/B- and CI-values are printed in the same column.
* Added parameter "cellSpacing" to functions "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm", which is a convenient parameter for changing cell spacing, alternatively to using the "CSS" parameter.

Bug fixes:
* Fixed bug in "sju.reliability" when data frame had too less columns, and row names of return value could not be set.
* Fixed bug in "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm" (p-values shown as numbers were not center aligned by default).

* Added parameter "startAxisAt" to function "sjp.grpfrq" for cases where variable values have a range starting with a higher lowest value (e.g. ranging from 5-15).

Bug fixes:
* Fixed bug in function "sjp.corr" with p-value-labels, when p-values were printed as "*".
* Fixed typo in functions "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm" where in the annotation row "*" was labelled as "p<0.005" (and not "p<0.05").
* Minor bug fixes.

Various:
* All "sjp." functions now (invisibly) return the ggplot-object as well as the underlying data frame by default. The "returnPlot" parameter was removed. In case you don't want to plot the graph, use the new "printPlot" parameter.
* Removed function "sju.modsum.lm" from official namespace (cleaning-up), since it was too specific and not generally useful.
* Improved table layouts for "sjt." functions.

* "sju.setNA" to quickly specify missing values.

Changes to functions:
* Functions "sjt.frq", "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm" now invisibly return the style sheet definition and the web page content for further use, for instance if several lm-tables should be saved to a single html file see example).
* Functions "sjt.frq", "sjt.lm" and "sjt.glm" now have more style attributes inside the style sheet definition, so it's easier to change the HTML-table's appearance via CSS.

* Added parameters "distance" and "agglomeration" to functions "sjc.cluster" and "sjc.dend", so distance and agglomeration methods for hierarchical clustering can be specified.
* Added parameters "alternateRowColors" and "stringValue" to function "sjt.frq".
* Default value of "autoGroupAt" parameter in functions "sjp.grpfrq" and "sjp.frq" was set to NULL (auto-grouping turned off) because auto grouping leads to unexpected behaviour with violin plots, box plots and histograms (wrong scale range).

Bug fixes:
* Fixed bug in function "sjc.grpdisc" (missing values in data frame have not been removed).
* Fixed bug in function "sjp.likert" when a dropped level from the likert scale (parameter "dropLevels") was outside of the legendLabels index (i.e. "dropLevels" was greater than "length(legendLabes)".
