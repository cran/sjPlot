sjPlot - Data Visualization for Statistics in Social Science
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Collection of plotting and table output functions for data visualization. Results of various statistical analyses (that are commonly used in social sciences) can be visualized using this package, including simple and cross tabulated frequencies, histograms, box plots, (generalized) linear models, mixed effects models, PCA and correlation matrices, cluster analyses, scatter plots, Likert scales, interpretation of interaction terms in regression models, constructing index or score variables and much more.

### Changelog of stable release 1.8.1

#### General
* Deprecated function `sjp.emm.int` was removed. Use `sjp.int` with parameter `type = 'emm'` to plot estimated marginal means.
* Minor improvements for `sjt.lm` and `sjt.glm`.

#### New functions
* `sjt.lmer` to print summary tables of linear mixed models.
* `sjt.glmer` to print summary tables of generalized linear mixed models.

#### Changes to functions
* Added `type = "probc"` to `sjp.glm` as alternative to `type = "prob"`. `type = "probc"` calculates predicted probabilities based on the `predict` function.
* Added `type = "y.prob"` to `sjp.glm` and `sjp.glmer` to plot predicted probabilities of the response.
* Added `type = "resp"` to `sjp.lm` and `sjp.lmer` to plot predicted values of the response.
* `sjt.grpmean` gets a `weightBy` parameter to compute weighted group-means.
* `sjt.glm` gets a `showHosLem` parameter to print results of the Hosmer-Lemeshow-Goodness-of-fit-Test for generalized linear models.
* Added white-background-alternative-themes of 538, 539 and scatter to `sjp.setTheme`.
* `sjt.frq` now warns when a variable has less labels than unique values.
* `sjp.int` for `type = 'emm'` now warns if interaction terms are not factors.

#### Bug fixes
* Fixed bug with `options(p_zero = TRUE)`, where leading zero was inserted after, instead of before decimal point.
* Fixed formatting bug for pseudo-R2 in `sjt.glm`.
* Fixed bug in `sjp.likert` when data frame had only one column.
* Fixed bug in `sjt.frq` when a data frame contained variables with only NA values.
* Fixed bugs in `sjt.frq` with weighted variables.
* Fixed wrong warning message, saying that package `lme4` is missing (should be package `arm` instead).
