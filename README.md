sjPlot - Data Visualization for Statistics in Social Science
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Collection of plotting and table output functions for data visualization. Results of various statistical analyses (that are commonly used in social sciences) can be visualized using this package, including simple and cross tabulated frequencies, histograms, box plots, (generalized) linear models, mixed effects models, PCA and correlation matrices, cluster analyses, scatter plots, Likert scales etc.

Furthermore, this package contains some tools that are useful when carrying out data analysis or interpreting data (especially intended for people coming from SPSS and/or who are new to R). These tool functions support reading and writing data (SPSS, SAS and STATA), variable recoding and weighting, statistical tests, interpretation of interaction terms in regression models, reliability tests and constructing index or score variables and much more.

In case you want / have to cite my package, please use `citation('sjPlot')` for citation information. Since this package makes heavy use of the [ggplot-package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), consider citing this package as well.

### Changelog of current stable build 1.7

#### General
* Renamed `sjs`, `sju`, `sjd` and `sji`-functions into more intuitiv and shorter function names.
* `autoSetValueLabels` and `autoSetVariableLabels` are now a global option. E.g., use `options(autoSetValueLabels = FALSE)` to turn off automatic value label detection in plotting and table functions, or `options(autoSetValueLabels = TRUE)` to turn on automatic label detection.
* `p_zero` is now a global option. Use `options(p_zero = TRUE)` to show leading zero before period in p-value, r-quared and phi labels.
* `read_spss` is now a global option. Use `options(read_spss = 'haven')` to set default package for readind spss data to haven, or `options(read_spss = 'foreign')` to make `read_spss` use the foreign package to read spss data.
* `value_labels` is now a global option. Use `options(value_labels = 'haven')` to set default attribute assignment in haven format (`labels` and `label`), or `options(value_labels = 'foreign')` to to set default attribute assignment in foreign format (`value.labels` and `variable.label`). Affects functions like auto-detection of labels, `set_var_labels` or `set_val_labels` etc.
* Removed `plyr` import and replaced with `dplyr` functions.
* Removed `reshape2` import and replaced with `tidyr` functions.
* Added two more sample datasets (`efc2` and `efc3`) to the package, which slightly differ in their structure.

#### New functions
* `write_spss` to write data frames to SPSS sav-files, including value and variable labels.
* `write_stata` to write data frames to STATA files, including value and variable labels.
* `read_stata` to read STATA files, including value and variable labels.
* `read_sas` to read SAS files, including value and variable labels.
* `to_sjPlot` to convert data frames imported with the `haven` package ([see GitHub](https://github.com/hadley/haven)) to a more sjPlot-friendly format.
* `to_fac` to convert (numeric or atomic) variables to factors, but keeps value and variable labels. Useful alternative to `as.factor`, when data has been imported from SPSS (e.g. with `read_spss`).

#### Changes to functions
* `read_spss` (former `sji.SPSS`) now supports reading data via `haven`'s read-function (see parameter `option`).
* `sjt.lm` and `sjt.glm` now also print multiple fitted models with different predictors in each model (e.g. when comparing stepwise regression). See examples in `?sjt.lm` and `?sjt.glm`.
* Added parameter `remove.estimates` to `sjt.lm` and `sjt.glm`, so specific estimates can be removed from the table output.
* Added parameter `group.pred` in `sjt.lm` and `sjt.glm` to automatically group table rows with factor levels of same factor.
* Improved `set_var_labels`, `get_var_labels`, `set_val_labels` and `get_val_labels` to cope with `haven` package data structure.
* Improved `view_spss` function (former `sji.viewSPSS`).
* Improved automatic label extraction for `sjp.lm`, `sjt.lm`, `sjp.glm` and `sjt.glm`.
* Improved pre-set theme `538` in `sjp.setTheme`.
* Added further pre-set themes to `sjp.setTheme`.
* Minor improvements in `sjp.lm` with `type="ma"`.

#### Bug fixes
* Fixed bug in `sjt.itemanalysis` [(#issue 8)](https://github.com/sjPlot/devel/issues/8).
* Fixed bug in `sji.setValueLabels`.
* Fixed bug in `sjt.frq` with string-variables that contained a larger amount of unique values including `NA`-values, when parameter `skipZeroRows` was set to `auto` (default).
* Minor bug fixes in `sjp.lm` with `type="ma"`.
* `weight` should now also include `NA`s.
