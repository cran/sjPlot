\title{Retrieve std. beta coefficients of lm}
\usage{
sjs.betaCoef(fit)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A fitted linear model.}
}
\value{
The standardiized beta coefficients of the fitted linear model.
}
\description{
Returns the standardized beta coefficients of a fitted linear model.
}
\note{
"Standardized coefficients refer to how many standard deviations a dependent variable will change,
        per standard deviation increase in the predictor variable. Standardization of the coefficient is
        usually done to answer the question of which of the independent variables have a greater effect
        on the dependent variable in a multiple regression analysis, when the variables are measured
        in different units of measurement (for example, income measured in dollars and family size
        measured in number of individuals)." (Source: Wikipedia)
