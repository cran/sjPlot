\title{Plot normal distributions}
\usage{
dist_norm(norm = NULL, mean = 0, sd = 1, p = NULL, xmax = NULL,
  geom.colors = NULL, geom.alpha = 0.7)
}
\arguments{
\item{norm}{Numeric, optional. If specified, a normal distribution with \code{mean} and \code{sd}
is plotted and a shaded area at \code{norm} value position is plotted that
indicates whether or not the specified value is significant or not.
If both \code{norm} and \code{p} are not specified, a distribution without shaded
area is plotted.}

\item{mean}{Numeric. Mean value for normal distribution. By default 0.}

\item{sd}{Numeric. Standard deviation for normal distribution. By default 1.}

\item{p}{Numeric, optional. If specified, a normal distribution with \code{mean} and \code{sd}
is plotted and a shaded area at the position where the specified p-level
starts is plotted. If both \code{norm} and \code{p} are not specified, a distribution
without shaded area is plotted.}

\item{xmax}{Numeric, optional. Specifies the maximum x-axis-value. If not specified, the x-axis
ranges to a value where a p-level of 0.00001 is reached.}

\item{geom.colors}{user defined color for geoms. See 'Details' in \code{\link{sjp.grpfrq}}.}

\item{geom.alpha}{Specifies the alpha-level of the shaded area. Default is 0.7, range between 0 to 1.}
}
\description{
This function plots a simple normal distribution or a normal distribution
               with shaded areas that indicate at which value a significant p-level
               is reached.
}
\examples{
# a simple normal distribution
dist_norm()

# a simple normal distribution with different mean and sd.
# note that curve looks similar to above plot, but axis range
# has changed.
dist_norm(mean = 2, sd = 4)

# a simple normal distribution
dist_norm(norm = 1)

# a simple normal distribution
dist_norm(p = 0.2)
