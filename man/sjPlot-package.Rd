\title{Data Visualization for Statistics in Social Science}
\description{
  Collection of plotting and table output functions for data visualization. Results of various statistical analyses (that are commonly used in social sciences) can be visualized using this package, including simple and cross tabulated frequencies, histograms, box plots, (generalized) linear models, mixed effects models, PCA and correlation matrices, cluster analyses, scatter plots, Likert scales, effects plots of interaction terms in regression models, constructing index or score variables and much more.

  \emph{What does this package do?}
  
  In short, the functions in this package mostly do two things:
  \enumerate{
    \item compute basic or advanced statistical analyses
    \item either plot the results as ggplot-figure or print them as html-table
  }
  
  \emph{How does this package help me?}
  
  One of the more challenging tasks when working with R is to get nicely formatted output of statistical analyses, either in graphical or table format. The sjPlot-package takes over these tasks and makes it very easy to create beautiful figures or tables in a very intuitive way.

  There are many examples for each function in the related help files and a comprehensive online documentation at \url{http://www.strengejacke.de/sjPlot}.
  
  \emph{A note on the package functions}

  The main functions follow specific naming conventions, hence starting with a specific prefix, which indicates what kind of task these functions perform.
