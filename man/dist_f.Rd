\usage{
dist_f(f = NULL, deg.f1 = NULL, deg.f2 = NULL, p = NULL, xmax = NULL,
  geom.colors = NULL, geom.alpha = 0.7)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{Numeric, optional. If specified, an F distribution with \code{deg.f1} and \code{deg.f2} degrees
of freedom is plotted and a shaded area at \code{f} value position is plotted that
indicates whether or not the specified value is significant or not.
If both \code{f} and \code{p} are not specified, a distribution without shaded
area is plotted.}

\item{deg.f1}{Numeric. The first degrees of freedom for the F distribution. Needs to
be specified.}

\item{deg.f2}{Numeric. The second degrees of freedom for the F distribution. Needs to
be specified.}

\item{p}{Numeric, optional. If specified, a F distribution with \code{deg.f1} and \code{deg.f2} degrees
of freedom is plotted and a shaded area at the position where the specified p-level
starts is plotted. If both \code{f} and \code{p} are not specified, a distribution
without shaded area is plotted.}

\item{xmax}{Numeric, optional. Specifies the maximum x-axis-value. If not specified, the x-axis
ranges to a value where a p-level of 0.00001 is reached.}

\item{geom.colors}{user defined color for geoms. See 'Details' in \code{\link{sjp.grpfrq}}.}

\item{geom.alpha}{Specifies the alpha-level of the shaded area. Default is 0.7, range between 0 to 1.}
}
\description{
This function plots a simple F distribution or an F distribution
               with shaded areas that indicate at which F value a significant p-level
               is reached.
}
\examples{
# a simple F distribution for 6 and 45 degrees of freedom
dist_f(deg.f1 = 6, deg.f2 = 45)

# F distribution for 6 and 45 degrees of freedom,
# and a shaded area starting at F value of two.
# F-values equal or greater than 2.31 are "significant"
dist_f(f = 2, deg.f1 = 6, deg.f2 = 45)

# F distribution for 6 and 45 degrees of freedom,
# and a shaded area starting at a p-level of 0.2
# (F-Value about 1.5).
dist_f(p = 0.2, deg.f1 = 6, deg.f2 = 45)
