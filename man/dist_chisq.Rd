\title{Plot chi-squared distributions}
\usage{
dist_chisq(chi2 = NULL, deg.f = NULL, p = NULL, xmax = NULL,
  geom.colors = NULL, geom.alpha = 0.7)
}
\arguments{
\item{chi2}{Numeric, optional. If specified, a chi-squared distribution with \code{deg.f} degrees
of freedom is plotted and a shaded area at \code{chi2} value position is plotted that
indicates whether or not the specified value is significant or not.
If both \code{chi2} and \code{p} are not specified, a distribution without shaded
area is plotted.}

\item{deg.f}{Numeric. The degrees of freedom for the chi-squared distribution. Needs to
be specified.}

\item{p}{Numeric, optional. If specified, a chi-squared distribution with \code{deg.f} degrees
of freedom is plotted and a shaded area at the position where the specified p-level
starts is plotted. If both \code{chi2} and \code{p} are not specified, a distribution
without shaded area is plotted.}

\item{xmax}{Numeric, optional. Specifies the maximum x-axis-value. If not specified, the x-axis
ranges to a value where a p-level of 0.00001 is reached.}

\item{geom.colors}{user defined color for geoms. See 'Details' in \code{\link{sjp.grpfrq}}.}

\item{geom.alpha}{Specifies the alpha-level of the shaded area. Default is 0.7, range between 0 to 1.}

\description{
This function plots a simple chi-squared distribution or a chi-squared distribution
               with shaded areas that indicate at which chi-squared value a significant p-level
               is reached.
}
\examples{
# a simple chi-squared distribution
# for 6 degrees of freedom
dist_chisq(deg.f = 6)

# a chi-squared distribution for 6 degrees of freedom,
# and a shaded area starting at chi-squared value of ten.
# With a df of 6, a chi-squared value of 12.59 would be "significant",
# thus the shaded area from 10 to 12.58 is filled as "non-significant",
# while the area starting from chi-squared value 12.59 is filled as
# "significant"
dist_chisq(chi2 = 10, deg.f = 6)

# a chi-squared distribution for 6 degrees of freedom,
# and a shaded area starting at that chi-squared value, which has
# a p-level of about 0.125 (which equals a chi-squared value of about 10).
# With a df of 6, a chi-squared value of 12.59 would be "significant",
# thus the shaded area from 10 to 12.58 (p-level 0.125 to p-level 0.05)
# is filled as "non-significant", while the area starting from chi-squared
# value 12.59 (p-level < 0.05) is filled as "significant".
